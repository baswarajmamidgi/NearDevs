### Inspiration
Being a developer, having a developer friend in our community makes life easier.The developers of a community has freedom of living together and share much time which results in a better throughput
## What it does
A developer registers into the application by submitting his details and area of interest in development.
He then can see the developers who are nearby his location and connect with them.

By submitting his details he is also visible to the nearby fellow developers

## How I built 

Three days earlier just got this idea and I found it helps the developer community come together
As I am proficient in android, used android-studio as a tool

1.Identified the requirements
2.Learn Facebook login sdk usage
3.Prepared the design
4.Developed the application
5.Tested with few friends


## Challenges I ran into
Identifying the potential of this Idea is the biggest challenge, met a lot of people, interacted with developer communities coding circles.



## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 

Built the application within two days.This is the fastest application development from scratch I have ever done.
Happy that I am building a solution which is useful for the community

## What I learned
Facebook tool, login tool is amazing as it reduces the burden of register, login, validation and security.
Also learnt about Google Maps API

## What's next for Near Devs
